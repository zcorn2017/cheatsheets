= binding isotherm (Binding “curve”)


Protein: $P$
\# binding sites: $N$

- some or all may be identical
- may show cooperativity

Ligand: $A$ : $A_"free" + A_"bound" = A_"total"$

Ligands bound per protein (moles of $A$ bound per mole of $P$):  $overline(v) = A_"bound" / P_"total"$ = number of sites occupied

$overline(v)$ is a function of $[A]_"free"$ not [protein concentration] ($[P]$, $["PA"]$)
Know $[P]_"total"$, can measure $[A]_"bound"$

*BINDING ISOTHERM*: $theta = ([H^+] / K_"acid")$ / $(1 + [H^+] / K_"acid")$ = *Fraction of sites bound* = $overline(v) / N$ = $"occupied sites per protein" / "total sites per protein"$

θ, the fraction of acetate with a bound proton, is dependent on the free proton concentration [$H^+$]

In this example, $"pK"_a$ = 6 or $K_"acid"$= $10^(-6)$

*same approach:*
$A_"free"$, $P$, $"PA"$, $"PA"_2$

$[A]_"total" = [A]_"bound" + [A]_"free"$, $[P]_"total" = [P] + ["PA"] + ["PA"_2]$
Measure $[A]_"free"$, $[A]_"bound"$ and $[P]_"total"$

*Spectroscopic Measurements*

protein fluorescence changes upon ligand binding

Δ(fluorescence) \~ θ, fraction of sites occupied

#image("/assets/Screenshot 2025-12-14 at 5.05.02 PM.png")

if $P_"total" << A_"total"$ then $A_"bound" << A_"free"$, so $A_"total" \~ A_"free"$


*Multiple Equilibrium Equations*

1. *Model-independent binding equation*: Adair’s equation Macroscopic or statistical binding constant; not refer to specific binding sites


  1. Adair’s equation makes no assumptions about the two sites.
  2. Even if the two sites are identical, K 1 and K 2 will be different.
  3. STATISTICAL binding constants: do not refer to "site 1" and "site 2"

PS: Keep only the first two terms if a dimer in which the two binding sites may be different

2. *Model-dependent binding equations*: Intrinsic binding constants; Assigned to specific binding sites

  *Simplified Adair’s equation*
  - Case I: N independent, equivalent sites
    $theta = (overline(nu)) / N = ([A] / K_0)$ / $(1 + [A] / K_0)$, same as HH equation
    - (e.g. a dimer with two identical and non-cooperative sites)

#image("/assets/Screenshot 2025-12-14 at 5.43.27 PM.png")
$theta = (overline(nu)) / 2 = ([A] / K_0)$ / $(1 + [A] / K_0)$, same as HH equation
- (e.g. A symmetrical tetramer 4 equivalent, independent sites)

- Case II: Several classes of independent, equivalent sites

3. *Positive cooperativity*
  - Macroscopic (statistical) vs. Microscopic (intrinsic) binding constants
