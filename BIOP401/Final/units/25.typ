- $K_M$ is the [substrate] at which enzyme velocity is 50% maximal
-$K_M$ is an “apparent” dissociation constant (for Briggs-Haldane)
- Small $K_M$ means tight binding; high $K_M$ means weak binding
- Useful to compare $K_M$ for different substrates for one enzyme
- Useful to compare $K_M$ for a common substrate used by several enzymes

*Linearized plots of steady-state kinetics data*
Lineweaver-Burk plot: $1/v_0$ vs. $1/ [S]$
The advantage of this plot is that the experimental points are better spread, so points at low $[S]$ are not emphasized disproportionately, as they are in Lineweaver-Burke plots.

*Kinetic efficiency* (specificity constant) = $k_"cat" / K_M$  (units $"M"^(-1)"s"^(-1)$)

*Patterns of inhibition:*
1. *competitive*: inhibitors and substrate compete for binding with enzyme.

2. *non-competitive*: inhibitors binds to enzyme with the affinity independent of whether substrate is bound or not, ESI is not active.

3. *uncompetitive*: inhibitor binds only to enzyme-substrate complex, ESI not active
