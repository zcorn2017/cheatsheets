= Allostery
Allostery is the process by which proteins transmit the effect of binding at one site to another, often distal, functional site, allowing for regulation of activity.
Binding of a ligand at one site influences binding of a ligand at a second site that is not overlapping

A dimer of dimers:  $alpha_1 beta_1 + alpha_2 beta_2 arrow.l.r (alpha beta)_2$

Critical interfaces: $alpha_1 - beta_2$ and $alpha_2 - beta_1$



Affinity of $O_2 arrow.t$  as binding to the tetramer:
$0 ->1-> 2 ->3-> 4$

Cooperativity results in larger changes in the O 2 loading of hemoglobin upon equilibration with the [O2 ] in veinous and arterial blood (binding isotherm is steep)

The quaternary structure of hemoglobin changes upon $O_2$ binding to the hemes by a rotation of the αβ dimer:
Changes in one subunit are transmitted to the other subunits through the subunit-subunit interfaces

*Competing “classical” models of allostery*

1. Sequential model: focuses on tertiary changes at one active site induced by the binding of a ligand at another binding site (KNF model) – induced fit

2. MWC (Monod-Wyman-Changeux model): focuses on concerted change in quaternary structure. well in quant. system，e.g. hemoglobin.
  - assumes allosteric proteins are oligomers of identical subunits
  - assumes all sites must be either high affinity or low affinity: symmetry
  - assumes change in shape of the entire molecule R (relaxed) and T (tense) states

MWC Model for Cooperativity: Three independent adjustable parameters
$K_R$ and $K_T$: association constants, $L$: equilibrium constant

Proteins are dynamic:
1. many vibrational movements
2. these movements are represented by the many possible protein states

Ligand binding can 
- shift the equilibrium to favor one of these states, similar to the idea of an equilibrium between the R and T states
- either decrease or increase the configurational entropy of the protein
