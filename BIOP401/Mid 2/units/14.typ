*Electric field* is the force on a unit (+1) charge placed at that point due to all the other charges (Sum over all charges present)

Dielectric constant not in vacuum: $epsilon_"medium"$  = $epsilon_r epsilon_0$


$T_m$ increases at low pH due to protonation of the acidic residues.

*The Born Equation*: free energy of solvation of an ion upon transfer from a vacuum to a solvent (e.g., water)

charges from water to low dielectric medium: generally destabilizing  high cost of dehydration to put charges in a low dielectric (Charged amino acids disfavored)

1. Hydration free energies of the charged groups become less favorable (higher dielectric const)
2. Unfavorable desolvation penalty incurred on forming the salt bridge is reduced
