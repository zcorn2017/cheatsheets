= Protein Hydration

*X-ray* crystallography: 
- Some water inside protein cavities - hydrogen bonded 
- Ordered water observed on protein surface
  - Mostly hydrogen bonded to polar atoms, polar/charged side chains, backbone C=O- 2 HOH N-H-OHH

  

*NMR*: can measure exchange rate with bulk - Water buried in cavities: Residence time $10^(-2) "to" 10^(-8)$ sec - Water Shell $<1$ nsec

*Molecular dynamics*: 
- Protein moves in solution with “associated” water corresponding to ~ 0.3 
- 0.5 gram of H2 O per gram protein

M in kcal·mol⁻¹·M⁻¹

fU vs [M] $Delta G^("urea")_(F->U)$
Linear fit to extrapolate to [urea]=0

*Osmolytes (stabilizer)* Sugars/ amino acids/ glycerol
U (unfolded)⇌F *(folded)⇌aggregated* (precipitated)

1. *Increase the surface tension of water*: more work required to make a cavity in the water solvent
2. *Exclusion from the hydration shell of the biopolymer*
  a) co-solvent exclusion around the protein, or b) preferential hydration of protein

Increase *chemical potential* both for folded and unfolded (larger, since larger cavity),


*solubility* of globular protein is the lowest at its *isoelectric* *point*
greater the net-charge -> greater the electrostatic repulsion between molecules -> extremes of pH, unfolding event that would expose nonpolar residues 

*manifestations of electrostatic effects*: 1. Stability 2. Alter pK’s 3. Influence local ion concentration 4. Influence charge movements at active site of enzyme 5. Ionic displacement: influence macromolecular complexation
