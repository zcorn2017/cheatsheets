Amino acids are chiral (L and D). only *L-form* exists in polypeptides

two charged groups of opposite sign constitute a *salt bridge*.

*Aromaticity*: Delocalized electrons in aromatic side chains can participate in weak electrostatic interactions (positive rings attract pi)

more than 25% identical, then they be *homologous*

*trans* peptide bond favored

Rotational angle ω is limited to 0 o (cis) and 180 o (trans)

$phi$: N-$C_alpha$ $C_alpha$-C: $psi$

*Proline* can form a *cis X-Pro* peptide bond

α-helix: 1-5 helix
- $5_3$ helix 18 residues in the repeating unit
- 5 turns in the repeating unit

$3.6_13$ helix
- 3.6 residues per turn: (18 residues = 5 turns)
- 13 atoms in the loop formed by the hydrogen bond

right-handed

side chains of a left-handed alpha helix too close to the backbone so the right-handed conformation is more favored energetically.

0.5 – 0.7 unit charge (oriented along the same direction, N: +, C: +) at the end of the helix with an average length (12-14 residues)


Why $alpha$ helix? loss of configurational entropy of side chains upon forming a-helix
Ala < Leu < Trp < Met < Phe < Ile < Tyr < Val (More Opposed)

Glycine is favored at N cap because its small size allows $H_2O$ to form hydrogen bonds with the amino group of the N cap residue

3.5% of helices in globular proteins are $3_10$
helix $3_10$= $3.2$ residues/turn, 10 atoms in ring
1-4 helix found on a binding site or active site

β-strand only stable in β-sheet (less than 5 strands are rare)

Silk: (- Gly-Ser-Gly-Ala-Gly-Ala-)n strong but are not extendible

*Structural Motifs*: arrangements of secondary structural elements that are found in different proteins
A few examples of structural motifs found in proteins
1. *Coiled-coil*: packed a-helices the Coiled-Coil Sequence has heptapeptide sequence repeat: (abcdefg)n
2. *Rossman fold*: always right-handed. in nucleotide-binding proteins
3. *TIM Barrel fold*: βαβαβαβαβαβαβαβα
