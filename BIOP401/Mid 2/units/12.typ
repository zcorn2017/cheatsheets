$T_m$ & ∆$H^o $ at $T_m$ & ∆$C_P$

the positive ∆Cp -> ∆$G_U^o (T)$ has max  
at low temp Cold denaturation

Under physiological conditions, $Delta G^o_U$ = 5-15 kcal/mol. Marginally stable

1. If ∆$G^U_o$ o is too big
- maybe inflexible
- maybe get trapped in improperly folded forms

2. If ∆$G^U_o$ is too small
- too susceptible to unfolding
- proteolytically unstable

*Spectroscopy* ($K_U$ is too small, needs int)

Assuming that ∆A is proportional to extent of unfolding
$-R ln K_U$ vs $ 1/T$

Small single domain proteins: (Spec) $Delta ^circle_"vH"$= $Delta H^circle_"cal"$ (Cal) 
- Spectroscopy dep. on coop unit. ΔH calo= 2 ΔH vh
- Calorimetry dep. on amount of protein (kcal/mol)

∆∆$G_U^o$ = ∆$G_U^o$ (mutant)- ∆$G_U^o$ (WT) 
Disulfide crosslinks can result in stabilization by an effect on the conf. entropy
