$"Volume enclosed by Van der Waals surfaces"/ "Total internal "="packing density"$

*Solvent accessible surface (SAS)* is defined by a water molecule (sphere with radius 1.4 Å) as it moves over the surface of a protein.

*hydrophobic force*
minimize the water-accessible nonpolar surface area and bury much nonpolar surface away from contact with water

unfolded protein $arrow$ folded protein: Decrease solvent-accessible nonpolar surface area -> Release water into the bulk -> Entropy increase due to solvent

Nonpolar side chains (A,V,L,I,M,F,W,C): 83% buried
Peptide groups (CO-NH): 82% buried
Polar side chains  (N,Q,S,T,Y): 63% buried
Ionizable side chains (D,E,H,R,K): 54% buried

*Distribution of Charged Groups*

1. Not randomly distributed: stabilized by

- opposite charged group

- dipolar interactions

- hydrogen bonds

2. 1/3 of charged residues are in “salt links” or ion pairs

- but only ~17% of these are buried inside protein

- only about 1 ion pair per 150 amino acids (rare)

- more frequently found in thermophilic proteins

3. Arginine can form 5 hydrogen bonds

- more likely to be buried than lysine


= Entropy drives protein folding
*Secondary structure formation* Favorable (–ΔH)	Unfavorable (–ΔS)	Many van der Waals + H-bonds offset entropy loss

*Tertiary structure formation*	Unfavorable (+ΔH)	Favorable (+ΔS)	Burying ions & breaking strong water H-bonds cost enthalpy, but hydrophobic effect (release of ordered water) gains entropy

*Ion solvation*	Very favorable (~ –60 kcal/mol)	—	Explains why charged residues stay exposed

Upon protein folding 
- hydrophobic residues move to the interior of the protein
- caged H2 O molecules are released
- enthalpy is gained: unfavorable (∆H +)
- entropy is also gained (∆S +): extremely favorable

1. Increased entropy from solvent “release”: hydrophobic
2. Decreased entropy due to loss of protein conf. freedom
3. Gain of intraprotein hydrogen bonds
4. Loss of protein/solvent hydrogen bonds
5. Favorable and unfavorable electrostatic interactions VDW interactions within protein charge-charge interactions


1. Extent to which hydrophobic amino acids are “buried” is proportional to surface area - related to Δ$G^circle_"trans"$ and “hydrophobicity”
2. Δ$C_P$ for proteins upon folding ($C_P^F - C_P^U$ ) is related to change in the surface accessible non-polar surface area -same as seen with alkanes

Based on
1. Solvent partitioning But which solvent? (octanol is often used) (Δ$G^circle_"trans"$)
2. Location within globular proteins Surface vs buried (computed surface area)
3. Tendency to be found in membranes buried helices


*Hydropathy Profiles* (transmembrane α-helices, 20 residues)
- Average hydrophobicity values of residues in the window is assigned to the middle residue
