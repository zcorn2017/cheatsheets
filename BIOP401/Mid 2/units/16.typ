This equation can be simplified if we assume ideal behavior (no molecular interactions and zero molecular volume) and a low concentration of solute

Osmotic pressure in reality: very non-ideal behavior of high concentrations of solutes

osmolarity of the cytoplasm of cells is 300 to 400 mOsM



Cells with rigid walls (plant cells, bacterial cells) can withstand positive osmotic pressure without bursting

PS: low osmolarity (0.4M)


*Tonicity* adjusts this value to include only those solutes that cannot pass through the membrane one refers to hypotonic and hypertonic solutions only referring to non-permeable solutes.



*E Coli Peptidoglycan layer (cell wall)* relatively rigid

1. Membrane allows water to freely pass
2. Permeability to small molecules is mostly controlled by protein-dependent transport systems
  *Active transport*: use energy to accumulate solutes in the cytoplasm
3. Osmolarity is dependent on the sum of activities of all ions, solutes etc.
== Low conc (< 0.2 M, glucose, MOPS, minimal salts medium)
osmolyte K+ Activity  ≈ 0.14 M

K + is also present in the cytoplasm that is NOT osmotically active - due to binding to DNA, RNA

*Add 0.5 M NaCl to growth medium （Water out, K+ in）*
1. Loss of water from cytoplasm -> cytoplasmic volume decreases plasmolysis – cytoplasm separates from the cell wall
2. Cell growth rate decreases in proportion to loss of cytoplasmic water
3. K + is actively transported in, to counterbalance high NaCl on outside.
4. Lose turgor pressure (~0)
*proline and betaine* are present in the growth medium (1 mM), these are actively transported in response to hypertonic shock have a higher φ than K+ (K+ does not go up as much), so cytoplasmic volume does not shrink as much and cell growth is faster

High concentrations of salts also demonstrate non-ideal behavior and can also stabilize or denature macromolecules

At concentrations below about 0.2 M

salts influence biopolymers by affecting electrostatic interactions The Debye-Hückel theory is a good description


== higher salt concentrations (>0.5 M)
- Some ions can bind to the polypeptide directly (causes protein denaturation) 
- Some ions prefer to interact with water and stabilize proteins
effects determined by effective charge density of the ion: smaller ionic radius/ larger charge on the ion

kosmotrope increases $T_m$
| chaotrope decreases $T_m$

Reason: A salt consisting of an anion and cation that have similar interaction strength with water tends to be less soluble and to stick together as an ion pair in solution.



Major *intracellular anions* are *kosmotropes* phosphates, carboxylates, sulfates

Major *intracellular cations* are *chaotropes* potassium (not sodium) protein nitrogenous ions (histidine, arginine, lysine)

kosmotrope/chaotrope pairing optimizes solubility and solvent-separated ions
